# GameEngine
My slowly developing game engine, 100% javascript.

This engine is nowhere close to end, even to the middle. I just started. I got many ideas and I slowly add new stuff. For now it's based on the web browser, doing lots of console.log etc. In the end all of this is going to run on the server (Node.js) (client in the browser obviously) and hopefully be a great game.

What you can see here is merely the logic of my game. I'm not even going to dive into the graphical stuff yet.

I want this to be something like Baldur's Gate but with all the MMORPG features. It's going to look almost the same, isometric view etc. Control over your character will be handled by both keyboard and mouse.
